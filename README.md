# jokeVault
A place where anyone can mint an NFT of an original joke to preserve it's originality. Inspired by Dave Chapelle's "Stolen Joke Story" in his "Unforgiven" special on Netflix. Originality is a property of any joke that holds intrinsic value.

The underlying purpose of this pet-project is to learn about various Web3 technologies.
